# ðŸš€ How to Connect Your Portfolio to GitHub

Follow these simple steps to get your portfolio on GitHub:

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up" and create your account
3. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Create a New Repository
1. Once logged in, click the "+" icon in the top right corner
2. Select "New repository"
3. Name it `portfolio` or `sujal-portfolio`
4. Make sure it's set to "Public"
5. **DON'T** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Download Your Project Files
Since we're in a browser environment, you'll need to download the files:

1. **Right-click** in the file explorer on the left
2. Select "Download" or use the download option in your browser
3. This will download all your project files as a ZIP

## Step 4: Set Up Git Locally
1. **Extract** the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer
2. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt** in that folder
3. **Run these commands one by one:**

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Portfolio website"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
